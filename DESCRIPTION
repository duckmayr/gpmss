Description: While there are various Gaussian process (GP) model implementations
    available, the extension packages written for R do not usually offer tools
    for hyperparameter tuning and/or do not provide a single consistent
    interface for the types of models useful for social scientists (akin to the
    general purpose 'GPML' software for MATLAB). Moreover, no existing
    implementation provides convenient tools for quantities of interest to
    social scientists, such as average marginal effects of predictors. 'gpmss'
    provides this functionality.
